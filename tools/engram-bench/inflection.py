"""Measures each language's inflection set on the strict pass alone.

A query counts only when the answer came from the strict pass: no result marked
`partial`, none marked `semantic`, and no hint saying terms were corrected. The
prefix, substring, typo, widened, nearest and semantic stages all announce
themselves one of those ways, so a query one of them rescued scores as a miss
rather than as the stemmer's work. `canary` is what keeps that honest: if a
mangled word is ever answered without announcing itself, the set cannot say
what it claims to and the run stops.
