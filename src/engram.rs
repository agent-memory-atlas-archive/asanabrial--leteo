/// produces — lowercase, with runs of `-` and `_` collapsed — and almost every
/// statement compares it the raw way, `ifnull(project, '') = ?1`, against a
/// value that has been through that function. Migration `0004` made the
/// convention true of the rows that existed when it ran.
///
/// It could not make it true of rows that arrive later, and this is where they
/// arrive. Adoption copies Engram's columns across verbatim, and Engram never
/// normalised; the migration also runs against the empty database this builds,
/// so it is long past by the time anything lands. A memory adopted as
/// `MyProject` would sit beside queries looking for `myproject` and go unread —
/// including by `find_candidates`, which is what `mem_save` uses to notice a
/// contradiction. That failure reports `candidates: []`: not "nothing here
/// disagrees" but "nothing was looked at".
///
/// So the fold happens here, at the one door rows come in by, rather than in a
/// migration that would have to be written again for the next adoption.
///

/// one another where the column is unique — `sync_enrolled_projects` holds one
/// row per project. `OR IGNORE` skipped the conflicting row and left both

/// claim: every surface that takes a project name normalises it, so Leteo has
/// always treated `MyProject` and `myproject` as one project, and the fold is
/// where the duplicate stops being one. In a table whose project column is not
