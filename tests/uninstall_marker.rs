//! The uninstall scripts decide that the binary started by looking for the line
//! `leteo uninstall --yes` prints first, and a shell script cannot read the
//! constant that holds it. This keeps their copies from drifting: a script
//! looking for stale text would count every binary as one that never started and
//! delete a model file the binary had chosen to keep.
//!
//! The scripts matching the constant is only half of it. Nothing here ran the
//! binary, so the `eprintln!` could be deleted and every test would still pass —
//! the flows in `check_install.sh` accept the report's `model_removed` line too —
//! and the marker could just as easily start being printed by the dry-run
//! preview. `the_binary_prints_the_marker_when_it_removes_and_not_when_it_previews`
//! runs both, which is the only thing that holds the marker to what it promises.
